DartX
=====

Motivation
----------

I'm really dissapointed by the [Google's Dart](http://dartlang.org). It's just a new-born Java and I cannot find something new in it. So, I design my ideal dartlang.

Features
--------

- Easy to learn because it requires only two keys.

How to Use
----------

1. Start DartX.
   $ bin/dartx
2. The cursor is changing its form: \, -, /.
3. Push any key to choose an instraction.

How to Try
----------

    $ bin/dartx sample/hworld.dartx
